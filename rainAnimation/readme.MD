This project creates a simple rain effect animation using JavaScript and CSS. Raindrops are generated randomly and fall from the top of the screen, disappearing after a short duration.

The JavaScript code waits for the HTML to fully load before running. It then selects the rain container element and continuously creates raindrops by generating new div elements with random positions, speeds, and opacity. These raindrops are added to the container and removed after a short time to keep the animation smooth. The raindrops are generated at regular intervals, creating a continuous rain effect.

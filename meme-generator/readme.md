A simple web application to generate and download memes using the Imgflip API.


When the index.html page loads, it fetches meme templates from the Imgflip API. The fetched meme templates are then populated into a dropdown menu. Users fill in the top and bottom text and submit the form. On form submission, the app sends a request to the Imgflip API to generate the meme with the specified texts. The generated meme is displayed along with a download button. Users can click the download button to save the generated meme to their device.
